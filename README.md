Statistically, the changes are relatively minor. The changes can be measures, but they have no significant impact on school performance.

#### Scores by Grade

Replacing the scores makes it impossible to compare the schools per grade. Since there are no 9th grade scores, there is no way to compare 9th grade at Thomas High School to other schools.

#### Scores by Spending

The scores by school spending also remains unchanged. This is due to the budget being unaffected by removing the 9th grade scores.

#### Scores by Size

The scores by school size does see some change. Here is the original analysis:
